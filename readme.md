### how to use?

#### notes
-   if tmux plugins not working delete plugin directory and run the install with prefix + I in tmux.conf again
-   if local dns is not working disable ubuntu default dns server (bind9 doc)
-   mounting ntfs file system on linux: `/dev/nvme1n1p2 /mnt/data ntfs-3g rw 0 0` in /etc/fstab
-   when using gradle project, java lsp is not woring when the java version of the gradle project is not installed (lsp shows everything as error)
-   if markdown preview in nvim is not working just go to installation path of plugin
    (probably: `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/markdown-preview.nvim`) and run `npm install` manually

### regolith customization
To change a regolith keybinding look into `/usr/share/regolith/...`.
There are several files which are all included by the main file.
The variables in these files can be set via the `.config/i3/Xresources` file.
For additional shortcuts just add to `.config/i3/regolith3/i3/config`.
